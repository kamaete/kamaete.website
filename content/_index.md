This is an accompaniment website to Sensei Mary's [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXOutfnelN0YDK2AIanp9Kvbr2Zk6AvbR) of [Oxford School of Martial Arts (OSMA)](https://www.schoolofmartialarts.com) home practice videos.

This website organises the videos from the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXOutfnelN0YDK2AIanp9Kvbr2Zk6AvbR) into coherent themes that allow learners to organise their learning accordingly. These themes are shown on the left-hand menu which link to the relevant sets of videos.

This website has been produced by one of Sensei Mary's adult students who takes full responsibility for any error or issues with the organisation of the videos from the playlist. Report any issue, suggest changes or contribute content by going [here](https://github.com/kamaete/kamaete.github.io/issues).
